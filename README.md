### âœ… Bonus Tips for OOP Projects in C++:

* Use **classes and objects** thoroughly to structure your logic.
* **Avoid global variables** â€“ encapsulate data properly.
* Try implementing **inheritance and polymorphism** wherever logical (e.g., for different types of accounts, users, vehicles).
* Use **file handling** (text or binary) for saving user data persistently.
* Add **basic authentication (login/signup)** for a more real-world feel.
